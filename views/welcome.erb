<p>Rock-paper-scissors (also known as rock, paper, scissors or paper, scissors, stone) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand</p> 

<p>These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together, forming a V).</p>

<p>A zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: one player wins, and the other player loses.</p>

<p>A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper").</p>

<p>If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</p>
